# Binary Numbers: The Language of Computers

Binary is the fundamental number system used by all digital computers. Unlike the decimal system (base-10) we use daily, binary uses only two digits: 0 and 1.

## Why Binary?

Computers use binary because:
- Electronic circuits have two states: on (1) and off (0)
- Simple and reliable for hardware implementation
- Easy to perform logical operations

## Binary Counting

Here's how to count in binary:

- 0 = 0
- 1 = 1
- 10 = 2
- 11 = 3
- 100 = 4
- 101 = 5
- 110 = 6
- 111 = 7

## Converting Binary to Decimal

Each position in a binary number represents a power of 2:

Binary: 1011
- 1 × 2³ = 8
- 0 × 2² = 0
- 1 × 2¹ = 2
- 1 × 2⁰ = 1

Total: 8 + 0 + 2 + 1 = 11 (decimal)

Understanding binary is essential for grasping how computers work at the most fundamental level.
