# Understanding Logic Gates

Logic gates are the fundamental building blocks of digital circuits. They perform basic logical operations on binary inputs to produce a single binary output.

## Basic Logic Gates

### AND Gate
- Output is 1 only when all inputs are 1
- Truth table: 0 AND 0 = 0, 1 AND 1 = 1

### OR Gate
- Output is 1 when at least one input is 1
- Truth table: 0 OR 0 = 0, 1 OR 1 = 1

### NOT Gate
- Inverts the input signal
- Truth table: NOT 0 = 1, NOT 1 = 0

This is an example post demonstrating the content structure.
